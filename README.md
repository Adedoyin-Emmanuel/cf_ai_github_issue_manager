# Cloudflare AI Github Issue Manager

An AI-powered GitHub issue manager built on Cloudflare Workers that ingests issues from any public GitHub repository, detects duplicates, groups related reports, summarizes long threads, categorizes issues by type (bug, feature, chore), and suggests priority levels to help developers resolve what matters most.

Powered by Workers AI, Durable Objects, and Workflows to demonstrate Cloudflareâ€™s end-to-end AI agent capabilities.
